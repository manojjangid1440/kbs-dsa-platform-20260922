# Business decisions still required

Status: OPEN. Proposed functional owners below come from the PRD, not named assignments. Engineering may implement configurable boundaries; it may not invent answers. Record resolution with date, decision owner, evidence, policy version, effective date, impacted requirements and rollout tests.

The following items are not missing from the PRD; they are genuinely unspecified business or contract facts in the supplied source. Engineering must not fill them with undocumented guesses. Owners are proposed functional owners, not named individuals.

Priority | Decision / why it matters | Proposed owner / required resolution

P0 | Exact identifier returned by each issuer/link so a KBS Advisor lead can match MIS without name/mobile guessing. | Bank partnerships + Admin: test issuer journeys and approve reference linkage per bank.

P0 | Which bank MIS field/value proves a commission-eligible  activation event  for each bank; HDFC  V + ACTIVE  vs  TXN ACTIVE - Rs 100  vs payout settlement criteria. | Finance + bank partnerships: signed per-bank payout rule/version and examples.

P0 | Per-bank payout rates, rate effective dates, payout eligibility hold, duplicate/reissued card event identity and rate-change treatment. | Owner/Admin + Finance: approved commercial rate schedule and card-event key.

P0 | Both approvals for Advisor with  Admin as direct parent ; no Manager is naturally assigned. | Owner/Admin: designate independent Manager approver and auditable route.

P0 | Eligibility for purchased third-party customer list, DND/suppression checks, lawful consent, call timing, record retention/recording disclosure and WhatsApp use. | Compliance + telephony/communications provider: written SOP before activation.

P0 | Permissible Aadhaar verification mode and vendor/entity authorization; PAN and payout-bank verification mode. | Compliance + onboarding: provider agreements, consent text, data scope/retention.

P0 | Telephony provider feasibility of in-app originating/bridging, automatic legal recording, caller ID, recordings retrieval and full current pricing. | Engineering + operations: proof of concept and vendor quote.

P0 | Bank MIS file semantics: full snapshot versus delta, blank cell meaning, conflicting row ordering, bank timezone and corrections. | Bank operations + Admin: one approved profile per bank.

P1 | Admin-card catalogue source: actual issuer/card product inventory, benefits PDFs, accurate fees, active links and product-code-to-pincode mapping. | Product/Bank operations: approved canonical card entries.

P1 | Agent Code points to Manager or another person; effect of later code change on old vs future leads, reserved/paid payouts and approvals. | Owner/Admin + Finance: effective-dated attribution policy.

P1 | Telecaller training passing formula, video completion, retry limits and exact new deadline after Manager reactivation. | Operations + training Admin: approved configuration.

P1 | Calling-record dedup key, allocation policy, reassignment and lead-collision rules with an Advisor on same customer. | Admin/Operations: explicit record ownership and reporting rules.

P1 | Official Telecaller ID card fields/verification, expiration/revocation and customer share rules. | Admin + compliance: approved card template.

P1 | WFH network policy: authorized office egress IPs, dynamic IP/VPN, exception duration, device security and offline handling. | IT/security + Admin: enforceable access policy.

P1 | Payment rejection/cancellation/reservation release, partial payments, payout disputes and correction workflow (without building clawbacks). | Finance + Admin: approved finite-state payment SOP.

P1 | Current user load, number of records/day, calls/month, file sizes, document/recording retention, report refresh and response thresholds. | Owner/Admin + operations/engineering: capacity and acceptance targets.

P2 | Exact Manager/Accounts creation and general account-disable permissions; optional Admin/Accounts mobile access. | Owner/Admin: access matrix final sign-off.

P2 | Optional customer-facing follow-up messaging, notification channels, escalation/quiet hours and export/print policy. | Product/Compliance: approved channel/permissions policy.

28.1 Vendor selection and cost analysis workstream (bounded scope)

The original request asks for reliable low-cost third-party integrations. Compare only support services actually needed: OTP (unit price, resend and fraud controls), lawful Aadhaar/PAN/bank verification (per check, retries and regulatory authorization), telephony (connected vs attempted minute billing, number rental, call-bridging, recording/storage/retrieval, SLA, recordings consent) and WhatsApp (app hand-off vs Business Platform media/template/session pricing, document hosting, template approval and delivery reports). Collect dated, written India-market vendor quotes and forecast cost using KBS's actual monthly user/verification/call/message volumes. No unverified price or vendor is mandated in this PRD. Do not add an aggregator/bank activation-status API: MIS remains the bank-status source of truth.

28.2 Release gates

No production calling until consent/DND/recording/office-network safeguards and approved provider are operational. No live Aadhaar flow until lawful mode and processing agreements are approved. No automatic Advisor payout eligibility until bank-specific MIS trigger, reference matching, approved commercial rate and Admin-direct dual-approval routing are configured and tested. All three sample workbook schemas must pass import QA before the upload workflow is considered validated; live bank files may require additional per-bank profiles.

Additional engineering issues E01–E26 and gaps G01–G14 are tracked in [analysis](../analysis/gaps-and-improvements.md).
