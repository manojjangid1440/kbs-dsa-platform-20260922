# 10. Advisor onboarding, verification and reporting code

Authority: source PRD; full section reproduced, not an overview. Source paragraph range P0170–P0178.

**[P0171](../source/prd-verbatim.md#p0171)** 10.1 Signup steps

**[P0172](../source/prd-verbatim.md#p0172)** Public Advisor registration -> mobile entry -> OTP verification -> name and email -> identity-verification consent/instructions -> official Aadhaar verification through an authorized permissible method -> bank-account details -> cancelled-cheque upload -> optional Agent Code -> review/submission -> account available when mandatory review/verification is complete. Only name, mobile and email are mandatory personal profile fields explicitly specified by KBS; exact bank field validation and verification provider contract are OPEN. Record user consent before collection/verification and display the privacy notice.

**[P0173](../source/prd-verbatim.md#p0173)** 10.2 Aadhaar and verification safeguards

**[P0174](../source/prd-verbatim.md#p0174)** The verification must be authentic and compliant; do not presume KBS is entitled to use an online Aadhaar authentication API merely because a vendor offers one. Supported lawful options may include consent-based UIDAI paperless offline e-KYC/QR verification or a properly authorized partner route, to be selected after legal/provider review. Where offline verification is used, verify signed evidence and retain only minimum permitted evidence/results under approved policy, never casually log a full Aadhaar number, XML/share code or Aadhaar image. Reference: UIDAI offline verification guidance at https://uidai.gov.in/en/307-faqs/authentication/offline-aadhaar-data-verification-service.html. OPEN: exact legal role of KBS, provider eligibility, permitted workflow, storage/retention and user-consent wording.

**[P0175](../source/prd-verbatim.md#p0175)** 10.3 PAN and bank information

**[P0176](../source/prd-verbatim.md#p0176)** Advisor onboarding must securely collect bank details for external manual payouts and allow a cancelled-cheque file; PAN verification appears in the customer lead journey. If KBS also requires Advisor PAN or payout-bank verification, that is a separate OPEN onboarding requirement rather than an assumed field. Mask account numbers in ordinary views; limit full bank-details access to authorized personnel, and log privileged access. Keep verification result, request/reference and failure/retry states distinct from bank MIS card status.

**[P0177](../source/prd-verbatim.md#p0177)** 10.4 Agent Code and ownership

**[P0178](../source/prd-verbatim.md#p0178)** Advisor may enter an Agent Code during signup or later in Profile. A valid code assigns the Advisor to its mapped person/Manager; empty code assigns the Advisor directly under the sole Admin. Show the resulting reporting person to the Advisor, Admin and appropriate Manager. Reject an unknown/revoked code with a clear message and preserve a pending/none result rather than assigning it to a random Manager. OPEN: code format, whether a code can point to anyone other than Manager/Admin, code expiry, repeated code changes, reparenting approval, and effective date for future vs historical leads/payouts. These policies must be resolved explicitly to prevent payout attribution changes.
