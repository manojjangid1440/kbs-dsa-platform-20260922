# 11. Advisor credit-card discovery and lead/application experience

Authority: source PRD; full section reproduced, not an overview. Source paragraph range P0179–P0201.

**[P0180](../source/prd-verbatim.md#p0180)** 11.1 Business flow (corrected)

**[P0181](../source/prd-verbatim.md#p0181)** Onboard and log in -> browse/search/filter cards -> inspect card and available pincode sourcing -> select card -> create customer operational lead -> verify/collect customer information and declarations -> review -> record lead reference -> share/open Admin-managed bank application link -> await/display bank-reported MIS status and remarks -> act on a genuinely reported issue if relevant -> request payout only when the appropriate activation event is confirmed in MIS. This is a user interaction sequence, not a predefined bank status timeline.

**[P0182](../source/prd-verbatim.md#p0182)** 11.2 Credit Card Home

**[P0183](../source/prd-verbatim.md#p0183)** Show card search/discovery entry, Create Lead, My Credit Card Leads, Pending Actions based on actual actionable information, MIS/status updates, own activated cards and payout access. Display high-level counts by their correct provenance, e.g., total operational leads vs MIS-confirmed activated cards. Make navigation suitable for field use and avoid claiming all leads are 'processing' by default.

**[P0184](../source/prd-verbatim.md#p0184)** 11.3 Catalogue, categories and details

**[P0185](../source/prd-verbatim.md#p0185)** Browse Admin-published card catalogue; filter by category (Travel, Shopping, Premium/Top, Fuel, other), card/issuer and relevant fees/benefit/location attributes. Detail displays image, bank, category, key features/rewards/benefits, joining/annual fees, major relevant charges, high-level eligibility/disclosures, benefit PDF and Create Lead / Apply for Customer CTA. Category labels and any marketing phrases must not imply guaranteed bank approval. Pincode sourcing is location availability, not a credit eligibility result.

**[P0186](../source/prd-verbatim.md#p0186)** 11.4 Create customer lead — exact captured fields

**[P0187](../source/prd-verbatim.md#p0187)** Customer mobile number -> basic customer details/name -> PAN entry and verification state -> current residence pincode and confirmed city/state -> employment choice Salaried / Self Employed / Self Employed Professional -> annual income as per ITR -> required customer declarations, Credit Bureau acknowledgement and applicable consent -> review all values and selected card -> submit. Show step-level error/return-to-edit, maintain selected card throughout, avoid unnecessary duplicate customers and create a KBS operational lead reference on successful internal submission. PAN verification method/provider, allowed manual fallback and whether the customer or Advisor enters each item are OPEN integration/policy decisions.

**[P0188](../source/prd-verbatim.md#p0188)** 11.5 What 'lead created' means

**[P0189](../source/prd-verbatim.md#p0189)** On internal lead submission, show success, KBS lead/reference, customer, selected credit card, issuer and the immediate available action (share/open application link, View Lead, Create Another Lead, My Leads or Home). This proves only that a KBS operational lead exists. It does not prove that the bank has created, accepted, submitted, approved or activated an application.

**[P0190](../source/prd-verbatim.md#p0190)** 11.6 Bank application link initiation

**[P0191](../source/prd-verbatim.md#p0191)** From the saved lead, the Advisor selects Share application link or an equivalent customer-approved way to open the Admin-approved issuer link. Preserve tracking parameters and link version; associate sharing/open initiation events with the Advisor, customer, selected card and KBS lead. Where an issuer returns an application number by an explicitly supported and permitted mechanism, record it; otherwise show 'Bank application reference not yet available' and match when a reliable reference is later obtained. Do not call a link share 'Application Submitted' or infer bank status from a redirect. OPEN: how bank reference is captured for each issuer if not returned in shared link flow; this is required for deterministic MIS matching.

**[P0192](../source/prd-verbatim.md#p0192)** 11.7 Eligibility results and 'no-result' states

**[P0193](../source/prd-verbatim.md#p0193)** The earlier FOS draft requests an eligibility/card-result screen 'where applicable'. Preserve it only for validated, actually available sourcing/eligibility information from Admin-managed data or a separately approved lawful customer-verification process; do not invent eligibility from pincode, initial lead creation or link opening. If a bank-specific approved eligibility result is unavailable, show that no confirmed eligibility result is available; allow the customer to proceed only through the bank's intended application journey. Distinguish 'no card sourceable at this pincode', 'no eligibility result available', and a bank-reported decline in MIS.

**[P0194](../source/prd-verbatim.md#p0194)** 11.8 My Leads, search and filters

**[P0195](../source/prd-verbatim.md#p0195)** Advisor must have a single My Credit Card Leads area with assigned customer/card/issuer, KBS lead reference, bank application/reference (if known), creation date, CURRENT_STAGE, FINAL_DECISION, Card Activation Staus, relevant actual bank remarks and most recent matching MIS upload date. Search by customer name, mobile and reference; filter by issuer/card, date, bank stage, decision, activation, MIS freshness and actionable customer/Advisor tasks; sort by relevant date/status. Show only Advisor-owned leads according to accepted attribution rules.

**[P0196](../source/prd-verbatim.md#p0196)** 11.9 Lead details, next action and history

**[P0197](../source/prd-verbatim.md#p0197)** Lead detail combines (A) customer/selected card and operational events, (B) matched bank references and latest actual MIS values, (C) MIS-sourced remarks, and (D) payout eligibility/payment only when applicable. Do not display a fictional ordered bank timeline. Instead show a chronological MIS update history with the exact status values seen on each upload and the upload time; use reported event dates only if supplied. If the MIS identifies a real customer/Advisor requirement (for example document curing or KYC issue), show the reported detail and an actionable next step only if there is a verified route to act. Operational tasks manually entered in KBS are separately labelled 'Follow-up task', not MIS status.

**[P0198](../source/prd-verbatim.md#p0198)** 11.10 Pending Actions and notifications

**[P0199](../source/prd-verbatim.md#p0199)** A Pending Actions view groups concrete tasks with customer/card/issuer, owning party, what to do, source (MIS field or KBS operational task), date and permitted CTA. Do not produce a task merely because a row has no MIS status or a generic 'Inprocess' value. If source data does not identify an owner or remedy, show the actual bank text without inventing who must act. From the notification, navigate to the correct lead and its current data. KBS announcements may be shown distinctly from MIS alerts.

**[P0200](../source/prd-verbatim.md#p0200)** 11.11 Advisor profile and support

**[P0201](../source/prd-verbatim.md#p0201)** Profile shows name, registered mobile, email, identity-verification summary, reporting relationship/Agent Code, bank payout-details summary (masked), support/help and logout. Allow Advisor to submit a code later under an auditable, agreed effective-date policy. Sensitive identity/cheque files must not be exposed in generic profile cards or notifications.
